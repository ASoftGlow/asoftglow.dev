                    Once during 2022, I helped my school comp sci teacher fix an app he had start on
                    <a href="https://www.code.org">Code.org</a> to help pick his hockey lineups (he was a hockey coach).
                    He had already had the design set, but the code wasn't working as intended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its function is simple: on the right is a list of available players.
                    Groups of selects represent the various positions (see above left figure). Select a player and it's removed from the roster list.
                    Click the "Update" button to display the positions in a cleaner format so a screenshot can be taken and sent to the team (see above right figure).

                <h2>Revamped Project</h2>
                <p>
                    A year later, I had completely forgotten about it until he told me, to my surpise, he was still using it.
                    He also said there was a bug when replacing a player that already been selected.<br>
                    I figured I might as while rewrite it not in Code.org, but in vanilla HTML and JS, which I hadn't done previously.<br>
                    It wasn't too difficult and took about 3 days.
                </p>
                <h3>Dynamic players</h3>
                <p>
                    In the original project, players were hard coded. That's not ideal.
                    I added an add and remove player button to rectify that. Additionally, I gave the option to import players from a newline seperated text file, as to make it
                    easier to add a bunch of players.
                    Unlike the original, the players and their selected positions are saved between refreshes using <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>PWA</h3>
                <p>
                    I also explored making it a compatible
